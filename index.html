					Well hello there! My name is Cassidy. I'm a startup advisor and
					investor, developer experience expert, and meme-maker on the internet.
					I'm also CTO at <a href="https://contenda.co">Contenda</a>, building
					<a href="https://www.brainstory.ai/">Brainstory</a>! Before now, I
					worked at OSS Capital, Remote, Netlify, React Training, CodePen,
					Amazon, L4 Digital, Clarifai, and Venmo, and graduated from Iowa State
					University. I currently advise some companies, including Netlify, The
					Sukha Company, Chainlink, and Plasmic, and do some angel investing, as
					well!<br />
					I run
					<a href="https://cassidoo.co/newsletter">a weekly newsletter</a> and
					love teaching and helping people become better coders! In my spare
					time, I love playing music, building mechanical keyboards and LEGO
					sets, playing word games like
					<a href="https://jumblie.com">Jumblie</a> (which I built!), and
					hanging out with friends and family. I also have a
					<a href="https://www.patreon.com/cassidoo">Patreon</a> if you'd like
					to chat with me regularly (our Discord group is so active I can hardly
					keep up!), get resume reviews, schedule mock interviews with me, or
					just play video games. No pressure to join in, and I appreciate your
					support a ton no matter what! <br />
					In terms of where I am on the internet (and off), you might have seen
					me in
					<a
						href="https://www.glamour.com/gallery/top-new-women-leaders-in-technology"
						>Glamour Magazine</a
					>
					or the
					<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B07L6S92HG/"
						>Big Dream documentary</a
					>
					a few years back, or my

					or
					<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/03/31/the-key-copy-paste/"
						>Stack Overflow The Key</a
					>
					or
					<a href="http://dro.ps/b/4WDYgO4TI2FO/t">Astrolokeys</a>
					keyboard projects in a couple dozen different publications! I also
					co-write the
					<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/newsletter"
						>Stack Overflow Newsletter</a
					>
					and am often on their podcast as well. I also made a successfully
					funded
					<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cassidoo/go-on-the-go/"
						>Kickstarter project called Go: On the Go!</a
					>
					to get people interested in playing the game Go. I've spoken at over a
					hundred events around the world, and have made online classes on
					<a href="https://scrimba.com/teachers/cassidoo">Scrimba</a>,
					<a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/cassidywilliams/">Udemy</a>,
					<a
						href="https://www.skillshare.com/r/profile/Cassidy-Williams/3062729"
						>Skillshare</a
					>, and moooore. I love speaking at events, and I have a
					<a href="https://cass.run/rider">speaker rider</a>, if you'd like to
					talk to me about one you're running. I also enjoy speaking on
					podcasts! Feel free to email me at cassidy at cassidoo dot co with
					details. <br />
					Alright, since you've read this far, have a joke: Why are mountains so
					funny? Because they're hill areas.

					Cassidy loves to make memes and dreams and software. She's currently
					the CTO at Contenda. She's worked for a variety of companies, large
					and small, advises startups, and she's had the honor of working on the
					board of various non-profits. She's active in the developer community,
					and one of Glamour Magazine's 35 Women Under 35 Changing the Tech
					Industry and LinkedIn's Top Professionals 35 &amp; Under. As an avid
					speaker, Cassidy has participated in many events including the Grace
					Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing, TEDx, the United Nations,
					and hundreds of other technical events. She wants to inspire
					generations of STEM students to be the best they can be, and her
					favorite quote is from Helen Keller: "One can never consent to creep
					when one feels an impulse to soar." She loves mechanical keyboards and
					karaoke.
